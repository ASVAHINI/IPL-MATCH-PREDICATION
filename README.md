# 🏏 IPL Match Prediction Using Machine Learning 🧠📊  
### Predicting Winners of Indian Premier League Matches with Machine Learning Algorithms  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
Cricket is a passion in India, and the Indian Premier League (IPL) is a grand celebration of it! This project predicts the outcome of IPL matches using **Machine Learning Algorithms** such as:  
- **Random Forest Classifier** 🌲  
- **Logistic Regression** 📈  

With an accuracy of **88.10%**, our model provides reliable match predictions based on various factors like team composition, toss decisions, venue, and previous match performance.
