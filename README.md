🏏 IPL Match Prediction Using Machine Learning 🧠📊
Predicting Winners of Indian Premier League Matches with Machine Learning Algorithms
🚀 Project Overview
Cricket is a passion in India, and the Indian Premier League (IPL) is a grand celebration of it! This project predicts the outcome of IPL matches using Machine Learning Algorithms such as:

Random Forest Classifier 🌲
Logistic Regression 📈
With an accuracy of 88.10%, our model provides reliable match predictions based on various factors like team composition, toss decisions, venue, and previous match performance.

🛠️ Features
Data Collection & Preprocessing: Clean and structured data sourced from Kaggle.
Model Training: Dataset split into 70% training and 30% testing using train_test_split.
Algorithms Implemented:
Random Forest Classifier for robust predictions.
Logistic Regression for probability estimation.
Web Application: A simple Flask interface for user interaction.
